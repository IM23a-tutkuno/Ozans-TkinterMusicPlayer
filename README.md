# Ozans-TkinterMusicPlayer
This is a MusicPlayer built with Python and Tkinter. The design was created by me with Figma and converted using TkForge.

##Installation
```bash
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

## Usage
pygame: is used for playing audio with pygame mixer music
mutagen: used for scanning the .mp3 file for the cover
pillow: used for implementing images into the code
Currently Supported AudioFiles:
.mp3

## IMPORTANT
The python script creates two folders in ProgramData: OzansMusicPlayer/AudioFiles
When the user uploads mp3 files from his machine they get copied into that directory. That folder also get scanned for mp3 files everytime the script starts.
